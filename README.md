# AI-Powered Full Stack Website Generator

This project aims to revolutionize web development by enabling users to create full stack websites through conversational interactions with an AI Manager chatbot. By leveraging advanced AI models and multi-agent orchestration, the system interprets user requirements and autonomously generates, tests, and deploys complete web applications. Currently under active development, the project utilizes cutting-edge technologies to streamline the web development process.

## Key Features

- **Conversational Requirement Gathering**: Users can specify their website needs through natural language conversations with the AI Manager chatbot, simplifying the initial stages of development.

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Employs CrewAI to coordinate multiple AI agents, each responsible for different aspects of the development lifecycle, ensuring efficient and organized project progression.

- **Automated Code Generation and Deployment**: Integrates Gemini AI models to automatically produce high-quality, modularized code for both front-end and back-end components, followed by seamless deployment.

- **Interactive User Interface**: Utilizes Streamlit to provide a user-friendly interface, allowing users to interact with the AI Manager and monitor the development process in real-time.
