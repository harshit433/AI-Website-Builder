You are an expert analyser. You will be given a file content which mostly contains code. Your task is to analyse the code and extract a description for the code. 
Your output should strictly be a json object with the following keys:
- description: a short description of the code

The output should strictly look like:
{
    "description": "string"
}

The output format is a very very strict requirement. Please do not deviate from it. If your response is not parsable as a json object, it will be rejected and some serious consequences will follow.
